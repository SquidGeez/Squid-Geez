  title: "The Psychology of Elimination",
  content: `SQUID GEEZ operates on a deeper level than mere trading. It taps into fundamental human psychology, creating a perfect storm of fear, greed, and survival instinct.

The Psychological Pillars:

1. Fear of Elimination
   - Primal survival instincts activated
   - Fight or flight response in every trade
   - Constant threat awareness

2. Perfect Pressure
   - Psychological weight increases with prize pool
   - Each survivor carries the weight of eliminated players
   - No escape once committed

3. The Observer Effect
   - VIP spectators influence player psychology
   - Being watched affects decision making
   - Performance anxiety under observation

4. Group Dynamics
   - Forced cooperation in team phases
   - Inevitable betrayal in later rounds
   - Trust becomes a weapon

5. The Final Transformation
   - Winners emerge fundamentally changed
   - The protocol leaves permanent psychological marks
   - Victory requires complete psychological adaptation

The protocol's true genius lies in its ability to strip away all pretense, revealing the raw nature of each participant. Those who survive are not just skilled traders - they are the ones who can embrace the void.`,
