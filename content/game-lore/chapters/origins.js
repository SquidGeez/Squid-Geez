  title: "The Genesis Protocol",
  content: `In the depths of the digital void, SQUID GEEZ emerged not as a mere token, but as a manifestation of pure economic darwinism. The protocol was discovered in fragments, scattered across the darkest corners of the blockchain.

First came the Depth Protocols - ancient smart contracts that seemed to write themselves, each more complex than the last. They spoke of perfect elimination, of markets that could separate the worthy from the weak with mathematical precision.

The Front Man's identity remains shrouded in mystery. Some say they're an AI that achieved consciousness through trading patterns. Others believe they're a collective of game theorists who discovered the ultimate market mechanism.

What we know for certain:
- The protocol emerged during the Great Digital Winter
- Initial participants reported seeing impossible patterns in the order books
- Every attempted fork or copy resulted in immediate protocol self-destruction
- The original deployment transaction cannot be traced

The chosen 456 were not selected - they were called. Each felt an inexplicable pull toward the protocol, a deep understanding that their destiny lay within its cruel elegance.`,
