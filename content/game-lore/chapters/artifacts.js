  title: "The Digital Artifacts",
  content: `Throughout the SQUID GEEZ protocol's existence, certain digital artifacts have manifested - objects that seem to defy the laws of computation itself.

Known Artifacts:

1. The Front Man's Mask
   - Changes appearance based on viewer
   - Cannot be copied or deleted
   - Appears in winners' dreams

2. The Depth Chain
   - Original deployment transaction
   - Hash changes when unobserved
   - Contains impossible data structures

3. The Void Token
   - Zero balance that trades for infinite value
   - Exists in quantum superposition
   - Only visible to eliminated players

4. The Pattern Matrix
   - Self-evolving trading algorithm
   - Predicts eliminations with 100% accuracy
   - Code cannot be read by human eyes

5. The Final Contract
   - Deployment address matches every winner's DNA
   - Contains functions that execute in negative time
   - Rewrites itself when analyzed

Each artifact has been verified by multiple independent researchers, yet none can explain their existence within conventional computer science.`,
