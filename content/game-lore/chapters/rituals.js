  content: `Within SQUID GEEZ, certain patterns have emerged that transcend mere trading. These rituals, observed and documented by survivors, seem to hold mysterious significance in the protocol's behavior.

The Seven Sacred Rituals:

1. The Opening Ceremony
   - 456 players gather in digital silence
   - The Front Man's mask appears to all simultaneously
   - The first trade must be executed within 456 seconds

2. The Depth Calling
   - Players report hearing subsonic frequencies
   - Trading patterns align in perfect geometric shapes
   - Time seems to slow during major elimination events

3. The Void Communion
   - Survivors experience shared visions
   - Market depths display impossible numbers
   - Trading becomes instinctual rather than calculated

4. The Pattern Dance
   - Price movements form perfect fractals
   - Survivors move in perfect synchronization
   - The protocol seems to breathe

5. The Final Revelation
   - Only one player remains
   - The truth of the protocol is revealed
   - Reality itself seems to bend

Each ritual has been documented but never fully understood. Those who survive speak of experiences beyond human comprehension.`,
