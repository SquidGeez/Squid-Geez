  title: "The Perfect Elimination Engine",
  content: `The SQUID GEEZ protocol operates on principles that defy conventional market mechanics. At its core lies the Perfect Elimination Engine - a system so precise it can detect the slightest hesitation in a trader's resolve.

The Five Fundamental Laws:
1. The Market is Absolute
   - All trades are final
   - No external interference is possible
   - The protocol cannot be stopped

2. Perfect Information
   - Every player sees the same data
   - No hidden information exists
   - All eliminations are publicly verified

3. The Depth Principle
   - Markets become more lethal over time
   - Survival difficulty increases exponentially
   - Each round eliminates exactly half of remaining players

4. The Front Man's Authority
   - Protocol governance is absolute
   - Rules cannot be altered once set
   - No appeals are possible

5. The Ultimate Prize
   - Winner takes all
   - No second place
   - Victory must be absolute

The protocol's genius lies in its simplicity. Every rule serves the single purpose of elimination until only one remains. The mathematics behind the system suggest it achieves a form of perfect economic darwinism - a true survival of the fittest in digital form.`,
