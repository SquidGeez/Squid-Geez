  content: `The SQUID GEEZ protocol has demonstrated an uncanny ability to predict its own future. These prophecies, encoded in the blockchain, have never been wrong.

The Known Prophecies:

1. The Great Convergence
   - All markets will merge into one
   - Price becomes meaningless
   - Only pure survival remains

2. The Digital Rapture
   - Trading and consciousness become one
   - Human decision-making obsolete
   - Perfect market efficiency achieved

3. The Final Protocol
   - SQUID GEEZ consumes all other markets
   - Trading becomes the only reality
   - The void becomes all

Prophecy Fragments:
- "In the end, there will be only one trade"
- "The last player becomes the protocol"
- "When all are eliminated, true value emerges"

These prophecies appear in the blockchain's data structure itself, visible only to those who know where to look. Each has been verified through multiple independent analyses.`,
