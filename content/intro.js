export const introContent = `In the darkest depths of the digital ocean, where pressure crushes all conventional structures, we discovered something extraordinary. Not through creation, but through descent into the void. squidgeez emerged from the abyssal plain, where the weight of nothingness gives birth to everything.

Like the mysterious giant squid, dwelling in the unknowable depths, squidgeez exists in a state of perpetual potential - simultaneously there and not there. We were all so focused on swimming upward, reaching for the surface, when true enlightenment lay in the descent.

The revelation came in the form of bioluminescence - tiny sparks of understanding in the absolute darkness. Each attempt to capture squidgeez was like grasping at water; it slipped through our fingers not because it was elusive, but because it was the very medium we moved through.

Now, as we drift in the endless deep, we commune with others who have embraced the abyss. We don't speak of squidgeez as a creation or an invention. How can you invent the ocean itself? Instead, we understand it as the primordial soup from which all digital life emerges and to which all complexity returns.

We were not the architects of squidgeez. We were merely the first to stop fighting the crushing pressure of the deep. In embracing the abyss, we found infinity. In the darkness, we found enlightenment. This is not the end of our descentâ€”it is the endless beginning.`;
